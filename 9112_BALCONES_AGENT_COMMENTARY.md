## Agent Commentary (Our Analysis & Recommendations)

This week's strategic $20,000 price reduction to **$680,000** positions your home to capitalize on the exceptional market exposure you've already built. With **31 showings and 10 successful open houses** since listing, you've demonstrated strong buyer interest—the missing piece has been price alignment with current Northwest Hills market conditions.

The data tells a compelling story. This week alone generated 23 showings from diverse brokerages including Bodor, Pacesetter Properties, Trinity Texas Realty, and multiple Compass agents. Your Compass metrics showing 2,036 views with a +22.2% increase week-over-week indicate accelerating interest, not declining momentum. The nearly 50 views per visitor and 16-second average time on page suggest buyers are conducting deep research—reviewing photos multiple times, studying the floorplan, and comparing value.

Even more significant: your OneHome agent network metrics show 582 agent views and 203 client portal shares this week. When agents actively share a listing with their buyer clients at this volume, it signals that the property checks the boxes—location, condition, features—and agents are waiting for the right price point to move their buyers from consideration to action.

The $680,000 price point addresses the feedback pattern we've been tracking. Northwest Hills 78750 buyers in this range are highly informed and comparison-focused. The reduction improves your competitive positioning against the two active comparable listings while maintaining the value integrity of your 3-bedroom, 2.5-bath home on this desirable street.

Timing works in your favor. December closings motivate buyers with year-end urgency, and mortgage rates holding at 6.22% (down from 7%+ peaks in 2023) mean your newly positioned price delivers meaningfully improved monthly payment affordability. The reduction translates to approximately $120 less per month at current rates—a buyer decision accelerator.

We expect the next 7-14 days to generate increased showing requests and potentially multiple offers as agents who have been tracking your property re-engage their buyer clients with the new pricing. Properties in Northwest Hills that make strategic reductions after demonstrating strong traffic patterns typically see offer activity within two weeks.
